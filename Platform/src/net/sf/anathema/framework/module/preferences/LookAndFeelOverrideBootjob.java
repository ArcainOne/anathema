/**
 * Removes the Look and Feel settings if the "overrideLookAndFeel" system property
 * is set to "true". This boot job will also revert the current Look and Feel to the
 * system Look And Feel. This may introduce visual artifacts since the Look and Feel
 * was already set when boot jobs are being executed. However this is intended to be
 * an emergency task when an invalid Look and Feel makes Anathema unusable, so the
 * user should only set this property temporary.
 * <p/>
 * This is also known to cause problems when it actually changes the Look and Feel but
 * there is nothing to about it. The user can always restart Anathema and remove the above
 * mentioned property. Starting Anathema with this "recovery" property will remove the
 * previously set probably corrupted Look and Feel settings and this is the actual goal
 * of this task.
